# Streamlit Secrets Template
# 
# Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml for local development
# On Streamlit Cloud, add these in the app settings under "Secrets"
#
# This file should NEVER be committed to git (it's in .gitignore)

# Example: Database connection strings
# [connections.postgresql]
# url = "postgresql://user:password@hostname:port/database"

# Example: API keys
# [api_keys]
# openai = "sk-..."

# For this app, secrets are managed in credentials.yaml (auto-generated)
# You typically don't need to add secrets here unless adding new features
# that require external API keys or database connections.
